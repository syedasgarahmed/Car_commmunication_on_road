I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to introduce you to a fascinating project that has the potential to revolutionize road safety and driver communication: "Car Communication on the Road."

Project Overview:
In our increasingly connected world, the concept of cars communicating with each other on the road is gaining traction. Our project envisions a scenario where vehicles share critical information to enhance safety and efficiency. Two key scenarios highlight the project's capabilities:

Lane Change Caution: Imagine a scenario where a car is about to change lanes. In this situation, the neighboring car sends a caution message to alert the driver of the lane-changing vehicle. This real-time communication ensures that drivers are aware of each other's intentions, reducing the risk of accidents during lane changes.

Speed Limit Alert: Another vital feature of our project is the ability to monitor and communicate when a vehicle exceeds the speed limit. When a car is traveling too fast, nearby vehicles can send a speed limit violation alert, prompting the driver to adjust their speed and adhere to road safety regulations.

Installation:
Getting started with our project is incredibly straightforward. Here are the simple installation steps:

Download: Begin by downloading the project's zip file from our website or designated source.

Extraction: Extract the contents of the zip file to your preferred location on your device.

Execution: Run the project using either "mode_1" or "mode_2," depending on your requirements.
